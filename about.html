            <br />
            <p>James Ray Hansen</p>
            <p>b.1981</p>
            <p>
              I create because it provides what is most natural within. I paint
              because it generates a sense of peace and clarity found nowhere
              else. When I work I find it revitalizing in the midst of solving
              creative issues. Strangely enough it generates the necessary head
              space to further the pursuit of truth. Painting solves problems.
              As a painter, I love to tell stories. I make art to illustrate the
              nature of how light behaves. I enjoy visually describing forms in
              paint, even through the use of everyday objects. I use my work as
              a road map for self introspection and discovery. Those who view my
              paintings I believe could benefit from this as well. I am inspired
              to make paintings that generate a feeling of time slowing down. I
              am inspired to create work that invites the viewer to indulge in
              the interconnection of light, shadow, form and color.. In the act
              of painting, it is a quest in seeking to understand itself. My
              work is an aim to be brave; to be brave enough to ask questions.
              This is an adventure I find to be immensely gratifying. My work is
              an attempt to express the urge to render the world in a sort of
              romantic stillness; always compelled to capture fleeting imagery
              and quiet moments of appreciation. I work to enrich other’s lives
              as well by helping others make sense of the world around them. My
              hopes are to help remind people of what is beautiful and to deepen
              our appreciation of the world around us. To attempt to express in
              a visual language, thoughts or experiences which would otherwise
              remain intangible is a part of my goals. I paint because the world
              longs to see eternal truths in new ways. "As an artist, I know I
              must devote 100% of myself to the task at hand. My intent has
              always been to exceed my present limitations creatively. My
              purpose is to portray themes that spark ourselves to see things in
              new light, moments where we can look into ourselves."
