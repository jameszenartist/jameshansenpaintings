# Personal Artist's Website

WIP of my first website/project.

![Github License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

Presently, this is my first (static) website that I have built.
As for the content, I have decided to showcase my career and work as a Classically trained Painter/Artist. https://github.com/jameszenartist/jameshansenpaintings.git

Eventually, my intentions are to turn this into something that's dynamic with some added features like having a newsletter to sign up to, along with e-commerce capabilities.
